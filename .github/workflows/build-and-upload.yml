# When executed manually, this will upload a ".devNNN" build to testpypi;
# when executed upon a release, it will upload a regular build to pypi.

# For pypi, you need to have the PYPI_USERNAME and PYPI_PASSWORD secrets configured.
# For testpypi, you'll need TESTPYPI_USERNAME and TESTPYPI_PASSWORD.
